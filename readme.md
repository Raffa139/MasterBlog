Using Flask to create a blog where one can share thoughts, ideas, and stories.

This version is rendered on the client (CSR) and a RESTful API is created using Flask.

In the blog, you are able to view all posts, delve into each one for more details, add
new posts, and delete any you donâ€™t want anymore.

Gaining hands-on experience with important Flask concepts such as routing, template rendering,
form handling, and basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
